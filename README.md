# Google Keep Clone/Extension

### Purpose
Purpose of the project is to recreate Google Keep using React or Next, a backend server, and a database (for the full stack).  Maybe add some custom compoonents to it to make it easier to take notes for large projects while maintaining the relative aesthetic.


### "Requirements" (More like cool stuff I want it to do)
- [] Card/tiling view
- [] Optional mega-card view for larger notes
- [] Multiple notebooks/topics
- [] Color customization
- []Font integration with Google Fonts

Lets see where this goes! :ocatacat:
